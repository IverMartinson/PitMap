-fixed GIF errors that were holding me up for weeks. In the standard code addition branch, first_code was mistakenly set to previous code instead of code, & clear code was not reseting current_highest_defined_code
-flipped output of GIF parser
-returned image has animation data
-frame is equal to previous frame
-if pixel is the transparent index ignore it
-un-flipped parsers that flipped data before
